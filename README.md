# TPPA_Partial

Weather Alarm â€“ Create an app that will allow you to set alarms for different times of
the day. Each alarm should be placed into a list after creation, sorted by trigger time
and should have the option to have as a ringtone the reading out loud of the weather
on that day (general presentation, temperature, wind, rain chance). The app should
get the location of the user automatically and should use a weather API for weather
information in that location.
